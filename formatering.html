    <h1>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</h1>
    <p><i>by William shakespeare</i></p>
    <p>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br />
        Thou art more <i>lovely</i> and more <strong>temperate.</strong>: <br />
        Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br />
        And summer’s lease hath all too short a <sup>date</sup>.<br />
    </p>
    <p> Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br />
        And often is his gold complexion <sub> dimmed</sub>;<br />
        And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br />
        By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimm'd;<br />
    </p>
<p>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br/>
        Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,<br/>
        Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,<br/>
        When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.<br/>
            So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br/>
            So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.<br/>
            </p>
